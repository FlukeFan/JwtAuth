<p>
    Security module.  This module handles sign-in (using ASP.NET Core Identity), and instead of the original cookie authentication,
    signs a JWT as stores that in a cookie instead.
</p>
<p>
    The JWT is signed using RS256, and the public key is exposed to other modules so they can verify the signature of the cookie.
